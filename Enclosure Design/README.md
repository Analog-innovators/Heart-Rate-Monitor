##  Enclosure Design using Solidworks

The enclosure of our heart rate monitor project was meticulously crafted using Solidworks, a powerful 3D modeling software. This phase of the project was essential to provide a robust and functional housing for our circuitry and components.

In our enclosure design, we took a comprehensive approach to ensure that all components were accommodated optimally. Spaces were carefully planned and designed to house the three PCBs that constituted the heart rate monitor's intricate circuitry. By providing dedicated mounting areas for each PCB, we enhanced the structural integrity and organized layout of the device.

The transformer, a pivotal component in our power supply circuit, also found its place within the enclosure. We allocated a specific location for the transformer, ensuring it was securely mounted while considering ventilation for heat dissipation.

To address thermal management, a cooling fan was incorporated into the design. The enclosure was thoughtfully crafted to accommodate the cooling fan, ensuring proper airflow to prevent overheating and maintain consistent performance.

Display visibility and user interaction were prime considerations in our design. We created an optimized space to mount the display, ensuring it was easily viewable and integrated seamlessly with the enclosure. User-adjustable components, such as potentiometers for tuning filters, were also given careful attention to make sure they were comfortably accessible without compromising the overall aesthetics and functionality.

Furthermore, we meticulously designed holes for the input and output interfaces. This included crafting holes to mount the 3.5mm audio jack for signal input, as well as apertures for power input and cable connections. These precise apertures ensured seamless connectivity while maintaining the enclosure's clean and professional appearance.

The culmination of our enclosure design was achieved through local 3D printing. By translating our Solidworks design into a physical enclosure, we created a protective casing that encapsulated our entire heart rate monitor project. This enclosure not only served as a shield against external elements but also contributed to the aesthetic appeal of the final device.

In essence, our Solidworks-based enclosure design was a testament to our commitment to detail and functionality. By thoughtfully considering the arrangement of components, thermal management, user interaction, and structural integrity, we created a housing that complemented the sophistication of our internal circuitry. The successful local 3D printing of the enclosure brought our design to life, underscoring the importance of an integrated and holistic approach to device development.

# Heart-Rate-Monitor

Our team, consisting of myself, Ravindu, Umesha and Dilupa, were able to apply our knowledge on circuit design, PCB design, enclosure design and software integration to create a device that progresses from sensing the heart rate to amplifying and filtering the signal, culminating in the display of the refined waveform. The main circuitry of the device was developed utilizing analog electronic components, as a learning opportunity of analog electronics as well. 

With the user-friendly interface, we were able to to output a patient's ECG waveform in real time and also tune the signal when necessary. Our project's output results compared favorably and accurately to a commercial patient monitor. With the wealth of practical and hands on experience we've acquired, we are poised to continue making impactful contributions to the advancement of healthcare through technology.

Enclosure Designs

The enclosure was designed by solidworks software. It contains a removable top lid, a removable front and the main body. The removability was integrated to fix and 
replace components. 

Holes surrounding the
box are integrated to ensure that the heat flow to the outside of the
box due to the power components inside.

A fan is also connected inside to help this.

The front contains the display and also the
knobs for tuning the filters. 

The switch on top
switches off the device, and can be used for
temporary situations. And the switch at the
back, switches off the transformer as well, saving
the power loss that happens at the transformer.
The enclosure also contains holes containing the
adapters to connect the power cable and also to
connect the 3.5mm jack.

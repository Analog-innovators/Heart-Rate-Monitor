# Heart-Rate-Monitor

During our third semester, we successfully designed an Analog Heart Rate Monitor, bringing together the realms of technology and healthcare. The project was also showcased for **EXMO'23** the flagship technological exhibition of the University of Moratuwa as a biomedical application of electronics and technology. 

Our team, consisting of Malith, Ravindu, Umesha, and Dilupa, were able to apply our knowledge of circuit design, PCB design, enclosure design, and software integration to create a device that progresses from sensing the heart rate to amplifying and filtering the signal, culminating in the display of the refined waveform. The main circuitry of the device was developed utilizing analog electronic components, as a learning opportunity of analog electronics as well. 

With the user-friendly interface, we were able to output a patient's ECG waveform in real-time and also tune the signal when necessary. Our project's output results were compared favorably and accurately to a commercial patient monitor. With the wealth of practical and hands-on experience we've acquired, we are poised to continue making impactful contributions to the advancement of healthcare through technology.
